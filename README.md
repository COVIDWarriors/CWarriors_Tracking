# COVIDWarriors

May 24th 2020, I've been working on this code for some days now, but, today my family has lost a very loved one, one of the most beatiful souls I have met in my life, María de Mar, my wife's cousin almost sister. It is not the SARS-CoV2, but triple negative breast cancer, that has severed her life after a five years fight. I want this code to help fight another beast that is severing too many lives to be a tribute to her all that are and will be missed. If I can, I will be coding the whole day, so the first run happens this hard day for me.

And it happened, and it run that day.
