# COVIDWarriors

May 24th 2020, I've been working on this code for some days now, but, today my family has lost a very loved one, one of the most beatiful souls I have met in my life, María de Mar, my wife's cousin almost sister. It is not the SARS-CoV2, but triple negative breast cancer, that has severed her life after a five years fight. I want this code to help fight another beast that is severing too many lives to be a tribute to her all that are and will be missed. If I can, I will be coding the whole day, so the first run happens this hard day for me.

And it happened, and it run that day. The first published version has some extra improvements, but it is called the "Mar" release, anyhow.

# What's this code for

This code simulates the movement of racks with samples through robotic liquid handling stations, organised as A, B and C, following the methods required to amplify SARS-CoV2 genetic material for rPCR detection.
